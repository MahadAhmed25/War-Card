# War Card Game in SwiftUI

## Project Overview

This project is an implementation of the classic card game "War" using SwiftUI. The game involves two players competing to win all the cards in a standard 52-card deck. Each player draws a card in each round, and the player with the higher-ranked card wins the round, taking both cards. The game continues until one player has all the cards.

This project was developed as a self-learning exercise to explore SwiftUI and enhance programming skills in Swift. It covers various aspects of SwiftUI, including user interface design, animations, and handling user input.

## Features

- **User Interface:** The game has an intuitive and visually appealing user interface designed using SwiftUI. It includes card animations, score tracking, and a clear display of the current round.

- **Deck Management:** The app manages the shuffling and distribution of a standard 52-card deck between two players. The deck is shuffled at the beginning of the game and redistributed after each round.

- **Game Logic:** The game logic determines the winner of each round based on the ranks of the drawn cards. In the event of a tie, a "war" occurs, and additional cards are drawn to determine the winner.

- **Score Tracking:** The app keeps track of each player's score, indicating the number of cards they have won. The game concludes when one player has all the cards.

- **Animations:** Utilizing SwiftUI's animation capabilities, the game features smooth and visually appealing card animations for drawing, playing, and winning rounds.

- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to work seamlessly on various iOS devices, adjusting to different screen sizes and orientations.
